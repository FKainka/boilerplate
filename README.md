# Boilerplate and Tutorial Sample Files
Boilerplate files for Joomla! 4 extensions.

# Tutorial Sample Files
You can find the Tutorial Sample Files in the folder *Tutorial* :)

# Installation
The boilerplates are in the folder src. They can be installed 
as-is using the Extension Manager. 
However, the component, module and plugin will be called Foo :)

To create installable zip packages, you only need to zip the folder with 
the files and it is ready to be installed.

# Customizing
To customize the boilerplates using your own name you need to take the following steps:

1. Do a **case-sensitive** replace on the following strings and replace them with your own name:
   * foo
   * Foo
   * FOO
2. Do a **case-sensitive** replace on the following tags with their actual information:
   * [DATE]
   * [PROJECT_NAME]
   * [AUTHOR]
   * [AUTHOR_EMAIL]
   * [AUTHOR_URL]
   * [COPYRIGHT]
   * [PACKAGE_NAME]
