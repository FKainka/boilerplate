= Creating a Simple Component for Joomla!4.x =

This is a multiple-article series of tutorials on how to develop a Model-View-Controller [[S:MyLanguage/Component|Component]] for Joomla! Version 4x. You can navigate the articles in this series by using the navigation drop down menu.

Begin with the Introduction, and navigate the articles in this series by using the navigation button at the bottom or the box to the right (''Articles in this series'').
Let's start with the introduction.

= Developing a Basic Component - Part 1 =

==Notes== 
* If you are new to Joomla!, please read [[S:MyLanguage/Absolute_Basics_of_How_a_Component_Functions|Absolute Basics of How a Component Functions]]. 
* This tutorial is for Joomlaǃ 4. For creating a component for Joomlaǃ 3 see [https://docs.joomla.org/J3.x:Developing_an_MVC_Component| Developing a Model-View-Controller Component/3.x]

== Requirements ==
You need Joomla! 4.x for this tutorial (as of writing currently Joomla! 4.0.0-alpha7-dev). You can download Joomla! 4 at [https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/tree/4.0-dev GitHub], on the [https://developer.joomla.org/nightly-builds.html Developer website] or you can create a free website at https://launch.joomla.org.


== Creating a simple Component/Developing a Basic Component ==

You can see many examples of components in the standard Joomla! install. For example
* Content
* Banners
* Tags or
* Contact

This tutorial will explain how to go about creating a simple component. Through this tutorial you will learn the basic file structure of a Joomlaǃ 4 component. This basic structure can then be expanded to produce more complex components.

=== File Structure ===

There are a few basic files that are used in the standard pattern of component development:

* <code>administrator/components/com_foos/Controller/DisplayController.php</code> - This file .

* <code>administrator/components/com_foos/Extension/FoosComponent.php</code> - This file .

* <code>administrator/components/com_foos/Service/Html/Foo.php</code> - This file .

* <code>administrator/components/com_foos/View/Foos/HtmlView.php</code> - This file .

* <code>administrator/components/com_foos/services/provider.php</code> - This file .

* <code>administrator/components/com_foos/tmpl/foos/default.php</code> - This file .

* <code>com_foo.xml</code> - This file contains information about the componente. It defines the files that need to be installed by the Joomla! installer and specifies configuration parameters for the componente.

* <code>script.php</code> - This file .

== Test your componente ==

Now you can zip all files and install them via Joomla Extension Manager. 

After that you can choose your component in the menu of the Joomlaǃ backend. 

[[File:componenttutorial1.png|700px]]

In the front end there is no change up to now. We are going to work on this in the next chapter.

== Component Contents ==

At this point in the tutorial, your component should contain the following files:
{| border=1
 | 1
 |administrator/components/com_foos/Controller/DisplayController.php
 |this is the administrator entry point to the Foo component 
 | new
 |-
  |1
 |administrator/components/com_foos/Extension/FoosComponent.php

== Conclusion ==

Component development for Joomla! is a fairly simple, straightforward process. Using the techniques described in this tutorial, an endless variety of componentes can be developed with little hassle.

== Test your component ==

Now you can zip all files and install them via Joomla Extension Manager.

After that you can see the view in the front end. 

[[File:componenttutorial1.png|700px]]

In the front end you can see the view if you open the address joomla-cms4/index.php?option=com_foos&view=foo.

[[File:componenttutorial2x.png|700px]]

At the moment you have enter the address manually. It would be nicer to have a menu item. 
We are going to work on this in the next chapter.

== Component Contents ==

Now we have a basic view in the backend and in the front end.































= Adding a menu type to the site part - Part 3 =

In this article we will cover how to add a menu item to a basic Joomla! component.

== Requirements ==
You need Joomla! 4.x for this tutorial (as of writing currently Joomla! 4.0.0-alpha6-dev)

== File Structure ==

=== Creating components/com_foos/tmpl/foo/default.xml ===

== Test your component ==

Now you can zip all files and install them via Joomla Extension Manager.

After that you can create a menu item. 

In the front end you can see the menu item and you can open the view with the help of the menu item.

At this point in the tutorial, your component should contain the following files:

[[File:componenttutorialdiff3.png|700px]]

== Conclusion ==
Now we are able to add a Menu Item to our component. This will allow us to access our component a menu item rather than having to remember what to type into the address bar. 
Currently the view does not show any data yet. In order to work with data, we will add a model to our component in the next chapter.

[[File:componenttutorialdiff4.png|700px]]

== Conclusion ==

At the moment you can create a menu item, that shows a special view of your component. 
What, if you want to show a view depending on a parameter? That is easy. You can add a variable request in the menu item. 
We are going to work on this in the next chapter.





























= Adding a variable request in the menu type - Part 5 =

For the moment, the displayed message is always fix. In Joomla! it is possible to add parameters to menu types.

== Test your component ==

Now you can zip all files and install them via Joomla Extension Manager.
After that you can add a parameter to the menu item. 

[[File:componenttutorial351.png|700px]]

Depending on the parameter, the view is set up in the front end.

== Conclusion ==
For the moment, the messages are hard coded or entered manually. We would like to store the data in the Joomla! database. 
Therefore, in the next chapter, we will add database access to the component.

== Test your component ==

Now you can zip all files and install them via Joomla Extension Manager. 

You have to run a new installation due to the changes in the database. 

After that you can add a parameter to the menu item.

== Component Contents ==

At this point in the tutorial, your component should contain the following files:

== Conclusion ==

Now our component has a database table where it can store data. In this chapter we have seen, how 
we can display this data in the backend. In the next chapter we will have a look, how we can use 
the data in the front end.

= Adding Associations - Part 15a =

== Requirements ==
You need Joomla! 4.x for this tutorial (as of writing currently Joomla! 4.0.0-alpha6-dev)

== File Structure ==

=== Changing x ===

The <tt>x</tt> file is the installation file.

==== Completed x file ====

The code for the <tt>x</tt> file is as follows:
 
<source lang="xml">
<?php

</source>


== Test your component ==

Now you can zip all files and install them via Joomla Extension Manager. 

You have to run a new installation due to the changes in the database. 

After that you can 

You see a new tab with the name associations. At the moment it is possible to 
select associations that are not possible. We will see how to fix this later.

== Example in Joomla! ==
