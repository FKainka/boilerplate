= Creating a Simple Component for Joomla!4.x =

This is a multiple-article series of tutorials on how to develop a Model-View-Controller [[S:MyLanguage/Component|Component]] for Joomla! Version 4x. You can navigate the articles in this series by using the navigation drop down menu.

Begin with the Introduction, and navigate the articles in this series by using the navigation button at the bottom or the box to the right (''Articles in this series'').
Let's start with the introduction.

= Developing a Basic Component - Part 1 =

==Notes== 
* If you are new to Joomla!, 
please read [[S:MyLanguage/Absolute_Basics_of_How_a_Component_Functions|Absolute Basics of How a Component Functions]]. 
* This tutorial is for Joomlaǃ4. 
For creating a component for Joomlaǃ3 see [https://docs.joomla.org/J3.x:Developing_an_MVC_Component| Developing a Model-View-Controller Component/3.x].

== Requirements ==
You need Joomla! 4.x for this tutorial (as of writing currently Joomla! 4.0.0-alpha11-dev). You can download Joomla! 4 at [https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/tree/4.0-dev GitHub], on the [https://developer.joomla.org/nightly-builds.html Developer website] or you can create a free website at https://launch.joomla.org.


== Creating a simple Component/Developing a Basic Component ==

You can see many examples of components in the standard Joomla! install. For example
* Content
* Banners
* Tags or
* Contact

This tutorial will explain how to go about creating a simple component. Through this tutorial you will learn the basic file structure of a Joomlaǃ4 component. This basic structure can then be expanded to produce more complex components.

=== File Structure ===

There are a few basic files that are used in the standard pattern of component 
development:

* <code>administrator/components/com_foos/Controller/DisplayController.php</code> - This 
file is Foos master display controller.

* <code>administrator/components/com_foos/Extension/FoosComponent.php</code> - This 
file is the Component class for com_foos.

* <code>administrator/components/com_foos/Service/HTML/AdministratorService.php</code> - This 
file is the Content HTML helper.

* <code>administrator/components/com_foos/View/Foos/HtmlView.php</code> - This 
file is the View class for a list of foos.

* <code>administrator/components/com_foos/services/provider.php</code> - This 
file is the The foo service provider.

* <code>administrator/components/com_foos/tmpl/foos/default.php</code> - This 
file is the template for a list of foos.

* <code>com_foo.xml</code> - This file contains information about the componente. 
It defines the files that need to be installed by the Joomla! installer and 
specifies configuration parameters for the componente.

* <code>script.php</code> - This file is the Installation Script file of Foo Component.

== Test your componente ==

Now you can zip all files and install them via Joomla Extension Manager. 

After that you can choose your component in the menu of the Joomlaǃbackend. 

[[File:as_j4_t_1_1.png|700px]]

In the front end there is no change up to now. 
We are going to work on this in the next chapter.

== Note ==

=== Version Number ===

If you ask yourself what version number you should take: 
Joomla strictly follows Semantic Versioning (2.0.0) and it be good if you do this, too.
See
https://developer.joomla.org/news/586-joomla-development-strategy.html#version_numbering 
and 
https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html
for more informations.

=== index.html File ===

Why was there an index.html file in almost every folder in Joomla in the past? 
The blank index.html file in each folder was to prevent directory browsing via 
web address. On a poorly configured web server someone could see all the files 
contained in a folder by simply browsing to the path, such as 
www.example.org/images/. This could be a potential security problem on 
servers without directory browsing (indexing) turned off. 
Having the blank <tt>index.html</tt> file returns a blank white screen to 
the browser rather than displaying the contents of the folder.

So, from a technical aspect, <tt>index.html</tt> files are not required 
on a good configured web server, but do prevent 
directory access on badly configured environments as already noted.

If you're looking to list an extension on the Joomla! Extensions Directory, 
(JED) it is not required to have <tt>index.html</tt> files.

If you want to add <tt>index.html</tt> files to your site, 
you can copy the script at 
https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/blob/staging/build/indexmaker.php 
and run it from a command line session on your server.

=== Joomla! Extensions Directory ===

You can use the JEDChecker extension at 
http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/miscellaneous/development/21336 
to check JED requirements.

== Component Contents ==

At this point in the tutorial, your component should contain the following files:
{| border=1
| 1
 |administrator/components/com_foos/Controller/DisplayController.php
 |this is the administrator entry point to the Foo component 
 | new
 |-
|1
 |administrator/components/com_foos/Extension/FoosComponent.php
 | the interface BootableExtensionInterface where a component class can load its internal class loader or register HTML services see https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/pull/20217
 | new
 |-
|1
 |administrator/components/com_foos/Service/HTML/AdministratorService.php
 | the html service see https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/pull/20217
 | new
 |-
|1
 |administrator/components/com_foos/View/Foos/HtmlView.php
 | file representing the view in the back end
 | new
 |-
|1
 |administrator/components/com_foos/services/provider.php
 | the service provider interface see https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/pull/20217
 | new
 |-
|1
 |administrator/components/com_foos/tmpl/foos/default.php
 | the default view in the back end
 | new
 |-
|1
 |administrator/components/com_foos/foos.xml
 |this is an XML (manifest) file that tells Joomla! how to install our component.
 | new
 |-
|1
 |administrator/components/com_foos/script.php
 | the installer script
 | new
 |-
|}


== Conclusion ==

Component development for Joomla! is a fairly simple, straightforward process. 
Using the techniques described in this tutorial, 
an endless variety of componentes can be developed with little hassle.

After that you can see the view in the front end. 

[[File:componenttutorial1.png|700px]]

In the front end you can see the view if you open the 
address joomla-cms4/index.php?option=com_foos&view=foo.

[[File:as_j4_t_2_1.png|700px]]

At the moment you have enter the address manually. It would be nicer to have a menu item. 
We are going to work on this in the next chapter.

= Adding a menu type to the site part - Part 3 =

In this article we will cover how to add a menu item to a basic Joomla! component.

== Requirements ==
You need Joomla! 4.x for this tutorial (as of writing currently Joomla! 4.0.0-alpha11-dev)

== File Structure ==

=== Creating components/com_foos/tmpl/foo/default.xml ===

The <tt>components/com_foos/tmpl/foo/default.xml</tt> file is the installation file.

Now you can zip all files and install them via Joomla Extension Manager.

After that you can create a menu item. 

In the front end you can see the menu item and you can open the view with the help of the menu item.

== Conclusion ==
Now we are able to add a Menu Item to our component. This will allow us to access our component a menu item rather than having to remember what to type into the address bar. 
Currently the view does not show any data yet. In order to work with data, we will add a model to our component in the next chapter.

== Conclusion ==

At the moment you can create a menu item, that shows a special view of your component. 
What, if you want to show a view depending on a parameter? That is easy. You can add a variable request in the menu item. 
We are going to work on this in the next chapter.





























= Adding a variable request in the menu type - Part 5 =

For the moment, the displayed message is always fix. In Joomla! it is possible to add parameters to menu types. 

== Requirements ==
You need Joomla! 4.x for this tutorial (as of writing currently Joomla! 4.0.0-alpha11-dev)

== Test your component ==

Now you can zip all files and install them via Joomla Extension Manager.

After that you can add a parameter to the menu item. 
This parameter is a text field.
The text you entered in this text field is shown in the front end.

[[File:componenttutorial351.png|700px]]

Depending on the parameter, the view is set up in the front end.

== Note ==

=== Why do we omit the close tag? ===

Omitting the closing tag helps you prevent accidental 
whitespace or newlines from being added to the end of the file.

For the moment, the messages are hard coded or entered manually. 
We would like to store the data in the Joomla database. 
Therefore, in the next chapter, we will add database access to the component.
